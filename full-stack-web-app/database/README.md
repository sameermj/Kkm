# Database Documentation

This directory contains the necessary files and instructions for managing the database of the full-stack web application.

## Migrations

The `migrations` folder includes migration files that define the changes to the database schema over time. These files are used to create, modify, or delete database tables and fields.

## Seeders

The `seeders` folder contains seeder files that populate the database with initial data. This is useful for setting up default values for users, chat rooms, and other entities required for the application to function properly.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Configuration**: Ensure that your database is set up and configured correctly. Update the connection settings in the backend `.env` file.

2. **Running Migrations**: Use the migration tool (e.g., Sequelize, Knex) to run the migration files and set up the database schema.

3. **Seeding the Database**: After running migrations, execute the seeder files to populate the database with initial data.

4. **Testing**: Verify that the database is correctly set up by running the application and checking for any issues related to database connectivity or data integrity.

For further details on specific migration and seeder files, please refer to the individual files within the `migrations` and `seeders` directories.
